Bubble is an access control protocol and SDK that brings private off-chain data to decentralised applications for the first time. It is a new tool in the Web3 Developer's toolbox that allows access to off-chain content to be controlled on-chain with a flexible api that can be built into any smart contract. By integrating the protocol into off-chain storage networks and cloud relay servers, the Web3 community can now offer private off-chain storage that restricts read/write/delete access to sensitive data for authorised users only. 

## A Powerful and Flexible Platform for Privacy Innovation

Smart contracts, with their transparent, immutable, interactive and stateful capabilities, offer a powerful and flexible platform for the control of personal data through transparent, dynamic on-chain service level agreements.  Custom smart contracts can define precisely the data access rules needed to govern data over its lifetime, dynamically altering its access controls in response to on-chain events, interactions and state changes. Combine this with our SDK’s advanced multi-user encryption capabilities, key delegation, and real-time notifications, and Bubble Protocol is powerful new tool for Web3 privacy innovation.

Want to restrict access to your content to NFT holders? Simply link your access permissions to your ERC721 smart contract. Want to implement an off-chain private file vault? Write a smart contract that specifies who has read or write access to your files and add functions to add and remove friends. Want to deploy a secure service for your customers? Design an on-chain service level agreement that automatically controls the life cycle of your customer's data, giving access only to the right people in your supply chain at the right time and in the right life-cycle state.

## Web3 Privacy Innovation for Developers and Businesses

We all understand the need for privacy, that is why we are so interested in Web3. As a Web3 community we need to be building apps, tools and protocols that minimise the exposure of our data whether through ZKPs, verified credentials, data tokenisation or direct access control. Not just in DeFi but in all areas of life, and both online and on the high street. We need to be building apps and infrastructure that address real-world privacy problems for end users and companies alike. 

Bubble Protocol’s on-chain control of off-chain data opens up a landscape of opportunities for dapp developers to explore new on-chain/off-chain capabilities and for companies to experiment with Web3 Privacy.  Furthermore, by integrating the protocol into their private servers, businesses have a hybrid storage solution that allows them to step lightly into Web3 without having to overhaul their infrastructure.

## The Future of Off-Chain Storage

The EVM-compatible [Bubble SDK](https://github.com/Bubble-Protocol/bubble-sdk) contains everything needed to create, manage and use encrypted off-chain ‘bubbles' held on any bubble provider. The [Bubble Private Cloud](https://vault.bubbleprotocol.com) is the first cloud-based bubble provider and is currently free to use for developers building on Bubble Protocol. It supports the Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche and Base networks right now. The SDK allows developers to deploy their own bubble provider or to integrate the protocol into an existing storage system.

Bubble Protocol’s mission is to improve global privacy, both online and on the high street. We are currently developing the Bubble Network, a P2P decentralised storage network with the protocol and payment incentives built in. Designed for simplicity and web2-like performance it will function like IPFS but with optional access permissions and a payment layer.

The Bubble Protocol project itself is community-run, and our forthcoming [governance token](https://bubbleprotocol.com/docs/tokenomics.pdf) will allow everyone to help shape the future of Web3 privacy.
